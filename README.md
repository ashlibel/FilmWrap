# FilmWrap
Inspired by Spotify Wrapped and my habit of logging every film I watch, this program tracks my movie history, analyzes patterns like genres, watch times, and ratings, and generates a personalized FIlm Wrapped. It works as a small streaming style analytics engine built entirely with data structures.
