# FilmWrap
Inspired by Spotify Wrapped and my habit of logging every film I watch, this program tracks my movie history, analyzes patterns like genres, watch times, and ratings, and generates a personalized FIlm Wrapped. It works as a small streaming style analytics engine built entirely with data structures.

1. Download or clone this project into your local machine.
2. Make sure you run the program from the same folder that contains your code file (e.g., `main.cpp`, `filmwrap.py`, etc.).

## Data Input (CSV)

FilmWrap reads your movie history from a CSV file that **must be in the same folder as the code**.

- Create a file named, for example, `films.csv`.
- The title rows must be:

  Title,Year,Director,Runtime,Genre,Date,Rating

  the date should be formatted as: YYYY/MM/DD
  Rating should be on the scale of the 5 stars
